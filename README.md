## Haskell Bindings to libaudioDB

[audioDB](https://github.com/TransformingMusicology/audiodb) is a
feature vector database. It allows high dimensional features extracted
from media content (such as audio) to be stored and searched using an
approximate nearest neighbour algorithm, locality sensitive
hashing. This package provides low-level Haskell bindings to the
`libaudioDB` library.

This code is currently in its very early stages and is not yet
generally usable.
